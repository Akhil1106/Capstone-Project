# Capstone-Project

Worked on a project that catered to find GTIN numbers using manufacturing catalog number. The main problem is due to various inconsistencies, 
the company is unable to maintain accurate records. So, we preprocessed the data & performed web scrapping in python to develop a new dataset 
meeting the needs of the business team.

The main objectives of this project is 

-->> To develop a robust web scraping tool that can efficiently collect GTIN numbers
-->> To implement data cleaning and validation techniques to ensure high-quality data
-->> To utilize data analysis techniques to uncover insights and patterns in the collected GTIN numbers

Data insights & Findings 
-->> The dataset for the years 2021 and 2022 had missing GTIN numbers that needed to be sourced by using web scrapping methods. 
However, in order to do so we first had to analyze how many catalog numbers were unavailable and separate them from the product description.
